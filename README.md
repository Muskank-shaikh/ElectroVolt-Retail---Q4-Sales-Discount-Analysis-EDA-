# ElectroVolt-Retail---Q4-Sales-Discount-Analysis-EDA-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an electronics retail dataset to analyze Q4 sales performance, discount effectiveness, customer behavior, and revenue leakage using Excel and Power BI.
## Project Overview

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an electronics retail dataset (Jan–Nov 2024).
The objective was to help a Retail Manager understand Q4 performance, evaluate discount effectiveness, and identify revenue leakages caused by operational issues.

The analysis focuses on sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and order outcomes, using Excel for data preparation and Power BI for analysis & visualization.

### Business Questions Explored

Why did Q4 underperform despite active discounting?

Which products actually drive revenue?

Are discounts translating into higher sales?

Which sales channels are losing revenue due to operational issues?

Where are stockouts and order holds impacting revenue?

### Tools Used

Excel – Data cleaning, feature creation, calculations

Power BI – EDA, KPIs, visuals, slicers, storytelling

Retail Analytics Concepts – Pricing, inventory, customer behavior

### Original Dataset Included:

Product details, order information, pricing

Sales channels, locations, order status

Transaction dates and customer identifiers

### Feature Engineering Performed:
To support deeper analysis, I created the following derived fields:

Revenue → Quantity × Price

Discount Amount → Calculated per order to evaluate discount effectiveness

Customer Type → Classified customers as New or Returning

Product Age → Categorized products as New Arrival or Old Stock

Month Name → Extracted from order date for seasonal trend analysis

Clean Date → Standardized date format for time-based aggregation

These features enabled analysis across pricing, customer behavior, inventory impact, and channel performance.

### 📈 Key Insight Snapshot

### Insight:
Although total revenue reached $907.75K, significant revenue remained unrealized due to:

On-hold mobile app orders

High website cancellations during Q4

### Key Findings:

5% smartphone discount failed to increase demand meaningfully

Old-stock laptops outperformed several new arrivals

Physical stores were the most reliable revenue channel

Accessories showed bundling potential but were underutilized

###  Recommendations:

Improve Q4 inventory forecasting

Reduce digital order cancellations

Test deeper or bundled discount strategies
